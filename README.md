# Biological Data Science

Biological data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines the principles of computer science, statistics, and biology to analyze and interpret large-scale biological data sets. The goal of this field is to extract meaningful insights from complex biological systems through the use of computational tools and algorithms.

Biological data science plays a key role in many areas of biological research, including **genetics**, **genomics**, **proteomics**, and **metabolomics**. For example, in genetics, biological data science is used to study the relationship between genes and inherited traits. In genomics, it is used to analyze the structure and function of entire genomes. In proteomics, it is used to study the structure and function of proteins. In metabolomics, it is used to study the metabolic pathways of organisms.

The field of biological data science has grown rapidly in recent years due to the explosion of biological data generated by advances in high-throughput technologies such as **next-generation sequencing** and **mass spectrometry**. These technologies have made it possible to generate vast amounts of data, which require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze and interpret.

To succeed in biological data science, one needs a strong foundation in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, as well as a deep understanding of biology. Some of the key skills required for success in this field include proficiency in programming languages such as Python and R, expertise in statistical analysis, and experience with data visualization tools.

In conclusion, biological data science is a rapidly growing field that plays a critical role in advancing our understanding of biological systems. With the continued development of high-throughput technologies, the demand for skilled biological data scientists is only expected to increase in the coming years.

In this repository I will add projects which uses biological data and create analysis pipelines for those which would primarily have a strong impression on Data Science related projects.
